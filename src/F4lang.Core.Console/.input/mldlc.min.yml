            Simulate production interventions on the development sense, analyse the impact of the model and sign-off on the model if all in order.
        
        - story: Simulate impact
          - description: |
              Simulate the impact of the model in production by predicting on the development sample and implementing the same interventions that will be implemented in production. 
              Observe if the metric of interest is impacted and if the model is performing as expected outside of a statistical sense.

              Evaluate the scoring function using unit tests.
              Ensure that the scoring function is working as expected and producing the same result as observed during development.

  - feature: Post-deployment impact analysis
        - description: |
            After the model has been deployed, analyse the results of the model by performing AB testing.
            Compare the results to the simulation results. 
            This is to ensure that the model is performing as expected in production and that the model is not performing differently in production than in development. 
            Determine if the model uplifts the metric of interest and if it is statistical significant.
        
        - story: Design AB test scenario
          - description: |
              Create the AB test scenario that will be used to compare the model results to the simulation results. 
              Allocate the required sample sizes to the test and control groups and monitor the pre-defined metrics of interest. 
              Determine the adequate sample size required, duration the experiment should run for and the cost associated.

          - description: |
              Define the metrics that will be monitored and create the reports that will be used to monitor the model performance. 
              Ensure that the reports are available to the relevant stakeholders and that both the model and its features are being monitored. 
              Setup alerting where required.
